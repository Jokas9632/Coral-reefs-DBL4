## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to ensure everything works correctly:

---

### 1. Install Google Drive for Desktop
- Download and install **Google Drive for Desktop**.  
- During setup, make sure to select **Stream** (not *Mirror*).  
  - **Stream**: Data is stored only in the cloud and not copied to your hard disk.  
  - **Mirror**: Data is duplicated on your disk (not recommended).

---

### 2. Shared Folder Setup
- A shared folder containing the necessary files has been created.  
- Make sure the folder is located in the **base directory** of your Google Drive.  
- If the folder shows up as a **shortcut**, donâ€™t worry:  
  - Thereâ€™s an algorithm included that can resolve shortcuts.  
  - Alternatively, you can simply provide the path to the shared folder directly.
